> Guardrail: This specification is the single normative source of truth for the feature. Track high- and medium-impact questions in [docs/specs/4-architecture/open-questions.md](../../open-questions.md), encode resolved answers directly in the Requirements/NFR/Behaviour/UI/Telemetry sections below, and use ADRs under `docs/specs/5-decisions/` for architecturally significant clarifications.

## Overview

Add automated NSFW content detection to Lychee via integration with the external [Lychee-NSFW-Classification](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-NSFW-Classification) Python service. Following the same REST + webhook architecture as face detection (Feature 030), Lychee dispatches NSFW scan requests after photo upload and receives classification results via a callback endpoint. Affected modules: backend (controllers, jobs, pipes, models, config, enums), admin settings UI, moderation admin page. The feature leverages the existing `is_nsfw` album flag and `is_validated` photo flag, extends the user trust level system (Feature 033) with a new `trust_but_verify` tier, and introduces configurable actions (block, flag for moderation, mark sensitive) based on detection severity tiers. A single `nsfw_status` enum column on `photos` (values: `pending`, `failed`, `review`, `visible`) tracks both scan progress and NSFW-specific moderation state — `null` means not yet scanned; `pending` means scan dispatched; `failed` means scan errored; `review` means held for moderation; `visible` means scan completed with no action or admin-approved. When the action is "block", the photo is hard-deleted (no row survives, so no `blocked` status is needed). The `nsfw_status` column combined with `is_validated` is displayed in the Moderation admin panel. The **uploader's** trust level (not the photo owner's — they may differ when uploading to shared albums) is snapshotted on the photo at upload time (`upload_trust_level` column) so the callback can resolve trust-level-aware actions without relying on the user's current trust level (Q-045-01 → Option B).

### Trust-Tier × Finding-Tier Action Matrix

The core decision engine maps each combination of user trust tier and detection finding tier to a concrete action. Three config settings modify the matrix:

- **`nsfw_check_block_action`**: controls what happens when a `check` user triggers a block finding. Options: `block` (default) or `moderate`.
- **`nsfw_monitor_block_action`**: controls what happens when a `monitor` user triggers a block finding. Options: `block` or `moderate` (default).
- **`nsfw_trust_but_verify_block_action`**: controls what happens when a `trust_but_verify` user triggers a block finding. Options: `block` or `moderate` (default).
- **`nsfw_trust_block_action`**: controls what happens when a `trusted` user triggers a block finding. Options: `block`, `moderate`, or `approve` (default).
- **`nsfw_sensitive_album_action`**: controls whether sensitive findings trigger the album NSFW marking. Options: `mark_album` (default) or `nothing`. Applies at photo approval time, not at callback time.

| Trust Tier \ Finding | Block | Review | Sensitive |
|---------------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Check** | Block or Moderate _(configurable via `nsfw_check_block_action`)_ | Moderate | Moderate + album action at approval _(configurable)_ |
| **Monitor** | Block or Moderate _(configurable via `nsfw_monitor_block_action`)_ | Moderate | Nothing or album action at approval _(configurable via `nsfw_sensitive_album_action`)_ |
| **Trust but verify** | Block or Moderate _(configurable via `nsfw_trust_but_verify_block_action`)_ | Approve | Nothing or album action at approval _(configurable via `nsfw_sensitive_album_action`)_ |
| **Trusted** | Block, Moderate, or Approve _(configurable via `nsfw_trust_block_action`)_ | Approve | Nothing or album action at approval _(configurable via `nsfw_sensitive_album_action`)_ |

**Block** = hard-delete the photo via `Actions\Photo\Delete` force-delete method (row, files, thumbnails permanently removed from all associated albums — no surviving row, no `blocked` status).
**Moderate** = set `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`. Photo held for admin review.
**Approve** = set `nsfw_status = visible`; scan result logged but photo remains visible.
**Album action at approval** = when an admin approves a moderated photo that has `is_sensitive = true` detections, set `is_nsfw = true` on each of the photo's associated albums (via `photo_album` pivot) — but only if none of the album's ancestors are already marked as NSFW (checked via `is_recursive_nsfw`). This is deferred to approval time so that a moderated photo doesn't prematurely flip the album to NSFW before the admin confirms the finding.

## Goals

1. Integrate with the Lychee-NSFW-Classification service to automatically scan uploaded photos for NSFW content.
2. Provide a configurable preset system (6 presets) controlling detection sensitivity at the installation level.
3. Allow admins to configure per-tier actions via the trust-tier × finding-tier matrix.
4. Introduce a new `trust_but_verify` trust level for users whose uploads should be scanned but auto-approved for non-block findings.
5. Integrate with the existing user trust level system to determine when NSFW scanning is applied.
6. Log all NSFW detections for audit and admin review.
7. Extend the existing Moderation admin page to surface NSFW-flagged photos (those with `nsfw_status = review`).

## Non-Goals

- Real-time/synchronous NSFW scanning during upload (scanning is async via job queue).
- Any UI changes to the photo upload flow (no blocking modal or progress indicator for NSFW scanning).
- Video NSFW detection (photos only, matching face detection scope).
- Custom per-album or per-user preset overrides (global preset only; see Q-045-07).
- Training or fine-tuning the NSFW classification model.
- Frontend NSFW detection result display on photo detail view (deferred).

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Success path | Validation path | Failure path | Telemetry & traces | Source |
|----|-------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| FR-045-01 | On photo upload, if AI Vision is globally enabled (`ai_vision_enabled = 1`) AND NSFW scanning is enabled (`ai_vision_nsfw_enabled = 1`) and the user's trust level requires scanning, dispatch a `DispatchNsfwScanJob` to POST the photo to the NSFW classification service. Scanning is applied for all four trust levels (`check`, `monitor`, `trust_but_verify`, `trusted`); the `nsfw_scan_trusted_users` config controls whether `trusted` users are scanned. | Job dispatches `POST /api/nsfw/detect` with `photo_id`, `photo_path`, and optionally `preset` (omitted when global preset is `default`). Photo `nsfw_status` set to `pending`. | `photo_id` must reference a valid photo; `photo_path` must be a resolvable path on the shared volume. | Service unreachable or returns error → `nsfw_status = failed`, log error. Retry with backoff (3 attempts). | `nsfw.scan.dispatched`, `nsfw.scan.failed` | Owner directive |
| FR-045-02 | The callback endpoint `POST /api/v2/NsfwDetection/results` accepts classification results from the NSFW service, authenticated via `X-API-Key` header against `AI_VISION_NSFW_API_KEY`. | Payload validated, detections logged to `nsfw_detections` table, actions applied per trust-tier × finding-tier matrix. `nsfw_status` set to `visible` (no action) or `review` (moderation). | API key must match config value; `photo_id` must exist; `status` must be `success` or `error`. | Invalid API key → 403. Unknown `photo_id` → log warning, 200. Malformed payload → 422. | `nsfw.results.received`, `nsfw.results.error` | Owner directive |
| FR-045-03 | Global config `nsfw_preset` determines which preset is sent to the classifier. Stored as a config key with enum values: `default`, `strict`, `moderation`, `nude_female`, `permissive`, `social_media`. When set to `default`, the `preset` field is omitted from the request to the classifier. | Preset value read from configs at dispatch time and included/excluded accordingly. | Config value must be one of the 6 valid enum values. | Invalid preset value → fall back to `default` behaviour (omit field). | — | Owner directive |
| FR-045-04 | **Block finding action**: When the callback returns `should_block = true`, the action depends on the photo's `upload_trust_level` per the trust-tier × finding-tier matrix. Each trust tier has its own config: `check` via `nsfw_check_block_action` (default `block`); `monitor` via `nsfw_monitor_block_action` (default `moderate`); `trust_but_verify` via `nsfw_trust_but_verify_block_action` (default `moderate`); `trusted` via `nsfw_trust_block_action` (default `approve`, also supports `block` and `moderate`). | Block: photo is hard-deleted via a dedicated force-delete method on `Actions\Photo\Delete` (reusing existing pivot cleanup, purchasable cleanup, `PhotoWillBeDeleted`/`PhotoDeleted` events, and size variant file deletion). The photo is removed from **all** associated albums unconditionally. Moderate: `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`. Approve: `nsfw_status = visible`, scan logged. | — | — | `nsfw.action.block` | Owner directive, Q-045-14 |
| FR-045-05 | **Review finding action**: When the callback returns `should_review = true`, the action depends on the photo's `upload_trust_level`. For `check`/`monitor`: always moderate (`nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`). For `trust_but_verify`/`trusted`: always approve (no action). | Moderate: `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`. Approve: `nsfw_status = visible`, scan logged. | — | — | `nsfw.action.moderate` | Owner directive |
| FR-045-06 | **Sensitive finding action**: When the callback returns `is_sensitive = true`, the action depends on the photo's `upload_trust_level`. For `check`: moderate the photo (`nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`) and mark the detection with `is_sensitive = true` so the album action can be applied at approval time. For `monitor`/`trust_but_verify`/`trusted`: the `nsfw_sensitive_album_action` config determines whether album marking is performed — `mark_album` or `nothing`. Album marking is always executed via a dispatched `ApplyNsfwAlbumSensitivityJob`. For non-moderated tiers (`monitor`/`trust_but_verify`/`trusted`), this job is dispatched **immediately** at callback time (auto-approval path). For `check` users, the job is dispatched at **admin approval time**. The job iterates **all** of the photo's associated albums (`$photo->albums` — many-to-many via `photo_album` pivot, Q-045-13 → A), and for each album verifies none of its ancestors are already NSFW (`is_recursive_nsfw`), setting `album.is_nsfw = true` if appropriate. If the photo has no albums (unsorted, i.e. `$photo->albums->isEmpty()`), behaviour is controlled by `nsfw_sensitive_no_album_action` config: `skip` logs warning and does nothing; `moderate` falls back to `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`. | See trust-tier matrix above. Album marking via async job respects recursive NSFW check. | — | — | `nsfw.action.sensitive` | Owner directive, Q-045-13 |
| FR-045-07 | **New trust tier — `trust_but_verify`**: A new `UserUploadTrustLevel` enum case `TRUST_BUT_VERIFY`. Uploads from these users are immediately validated (`is_validated = true`) like `trusted` users. NSFW scanning is always applied. Block findings are configurable via `nsfw_trust_but_verify_block_action` (default `moderate`). Review findings are auto-approved. Sensitive findings follow the configurable album action. | Upload: `is_validated = true`. NSFW scan always dispatched. Callback applies matrix actions. | — | — | — | Owner directive |
| FR-045-08 | User trust level integration: uploaders with `upload_trust_level = check` or `monitor` always have NSFW scanning applied on upload. Uploaders with `upload_trust_level = trust_but_verify` always have NSFW scanning applied. Uploaders with `upload_trust_level = trusted` consult global config `nsfw_scan_trusted_users` (boolean) to determine if scanning is applied. The **uploader's** trust level (from `$state->upload_trust_level` on the pipeline DTO, not from `$state->photo->owner`) is snapshotted on the photo at upload time via a new `upload_trust_level` column on `photos` (Q-045-01 → Option B). | `check`/`monitor`/`trust_but_verify`: always scan. `trusted` + `nsfw_scan_trusted_users = true`: scan. `trusted` + `nsfw_scan_trusted_users = false`: skip. | — | — | — | Owner directive, Q-045-01 |
| FR-045-19 | **Hide-on-scan (quarantine until result)**: Three per-trust-level boolean configs control whether a photo is temporarily hidden (`is_validated = false`) while the NSFW scan is in progress: `nsfw_monitor_hide_on_scan` (default `0`), `nsfw_trust_but_verify_hide_on_scan` (default `0`), `nsfw_trust_hide_on_scan` (default `0`). `check` users do not need this config because their photos are already hidden on upload (`is_validated = false` via `SetUploadValidated`). When the config is `true` for the photo's trust level, the `AutoScanNsfwOnUpload` pipe sets `is_validated = false` at dispatch time, placing the photo in the moderation queue. On callback, the restore logic is unconditional for non-`check` trust levels: if the photo's `upload_trust_level` is not `check` and there are no block or review findings (only sensitive or clean), `NsfwActionService` sets `is_validated = true`. This is safe because when hide-on-scan is off, `is_validated` is already `true` and the assignment is a no-op; when hide-on-scan is on, it restores visibility. If block or review findings exist, the normal action matrix applies (the photo is either hard-deleted, or remains in moderation with `is_validated = false`). **Rationale for making this a setting:** because the NSFW scan is asynchronous (round-trip to external service), if the classifier crashes or becomes unavailable, a photo hidden by this setting would remain in the moderation queue indefinitely. Admins who enable this accept that risk in exchange for preventing potentially NSFW photos from being temporarily visible during the scan round-trip. | Dispatch: `is_validated = false`. Callback clean: `is_validated = true` (unconditional for non-`check`). Callback block/review: normal matrix (delete/moderate). | Config must be bool. Only applies when NSFW scan is dispatched (both AI Vision toggles enabled). | Classifier crash → photo stays hidden in moderation queue until admin manually approves. | — | Owner directive |
| FR-045-09 | Actionable detection results are logged to a `nsfw_detections` table with: `id`, `photo_id`, `label` (typed as `NsfwDetectionLabel` enum), `confidence`, `bbox_x`, `bbox_y`, `bbox_width`, `bbox_height`, `area_pixels`, `area_ratio`, `is_block` (bool), `is_review` (bool), `is_sensitive` (bool), `created_at`. The `photo_id` FK uses `cascadeOnDelete` (matching the `faces` table pattern). `PhotosToBeDeletedDTO::forceDelete()` is also updated to explicitly delete `nsfw_detections` rows alongside `size_variants`, `statistics`, `palettes`, and `photo_album` cleanup (Q-045-19). Only detections from `block_detected`, `review_detected`, and `sensitive_detected` arrays are stored — `all_detected` is not persisted (Q-045-06). A single detection can appear in multiple arrays simultaneously; all three boolean columns reflect which tiers it belongs to. Dedup by photo_id+label+bbox: one row per unique detection per photo, booleans merged. | Each detection across `block_detected`, `review_detected`, `sensitive_detected` is matched by photo_id+label+bbox. One row created per unique detection with `is_block`, `is_review`, `is_sensitive` set according to which arrays it appears in. | — | — | — | Owner directive, Q-045-06, Q-045-19 |
| FR-045-10 | A new `NsfwPreset` enum with 6 cases: `DEFAULT`, `STRICT`, `MODERATION`, `NUDE_FEMALE`, `PERMISSIVE`, `SOCIAL_MEDIA`. Used for config validation and request building. | — | — | — | — | Owner directive |
| FR-045-11 | Admin can trigger a bulk NSFW scan via `POST /api/v2/NsfwDetection/bulk-scan`. By default scans photos with `nsfw_status IS NULL` or `failed`. Optional `force` boolean parameter re-scans all photos including `visible` and `review` as well (Q-045-09 → B). | Default: `NULL` + `failed` photos dispatched. With `force = true`: all photos re-dispatched. | Admin-only endpoint (existing `AdminMiddleware`). `force` is optional boolean, defaults to `false`. | — | `nsfw.bulk_scan.dispatched` | Owner directive, Q-045-09 |
| FR-045-18 | Admin can view the NSFW classification service's active runtime configuration and available presets via `GET /api/v2/NsfwDetection/config`. Lychee proxies the request to the external service's `GET /api/nsfw/config` endpoint, authenticated via `X-API-Key` header. The response contains two sections: `config` (active runtime settings as key-value strings) and `presets` (named preset objects, each with `name`, `description`, `block`, `review`, `sensitive` label-set configurations). The presets overview is displayed in a dedicated admin page accessible from the admin dashboard. | Proxy returns upstream JSON as-is. Frontend renders presets in a readable layout: each preset shows its name, description, and the three label-set tiers (block/review/sensitive) with their labels, confidence, area_ratio, and label_thresholds. | Service URL must be configured (`AI_VISION_NSFW_URL`). API key must be configured (`AI_VISION_NSFW_API_KEY`). | Service unreachable → 503 with error message. Service returns error → proxy returns upstream status. URL not configured → 503 with config error message. | — | Owner directive |
| FR-045-12 | ~~Removed — merged into FR-045-13.~~ | — | — | — | — | — |
| FR-045-13 | New single enum column `nsfw_status` on `photos` table (nullable string, default `null`). Values: `pending` (scan dispatched, awaiting results), `failed` (scan errored), `review` (moderation action applied — held for admin), `visible` (scan completed with no action, or admin-approved). `null` = not yet scanned. Combined with `is_validated` to provide full moderation context. When `nsfw_status` is set to `review`, `is_validated` is also set to `false`. Cleared by admin approval (set to `visible`, `is_validated = true`). On approval, if the photo has sensitive detections and `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = mark_album`, the album action is applied (see FR-045-06). There is no `blocked` value — block actions hard-delete the photo, so no row survives. | Set to `pending` on dispatch, `failed` on error, `review` or `visible` on callback success (per trust-tier matrix). Set by `NsfwActionService`. | — | — | — | Owner directive, Q-045-02 |
| FR-045-14 | New column `upload_trust_level` on `photos` table (nullable string). Snapshots the **uploader's** (not the photo owner's) trust level at upload time. The uploader and owner may differ — when User A uploads to User B's album, the photo is owned by B but the trust level is A's. The value comes from `$state->upload_trust_level` on the pipeline DTO (pre-resolved from the authenticated user at dispatch time), NOT from `$state->photo->owner`. Used by the NSFW callback to resolve trust-level-aware actions. Populated by the `AutoScanNsfwOnUpload` pipe during photo creation. | Value is one of `check`, `monitor`, `trust_but_verify`, `trusted`, or null (for photos uploaded before this feature). | — | — | — | Owner directive, Q-045-01 |
| FR-045-15 | Global config `nsfw_sensitive_no_album_action` determines fallback behaviour when album marking fires but the photo has no albums (`$photo->albums->isEmpty()` — unsorted photo with no pivot entries). Options: `skip` (log warning, do nothing) or `moderate` (set `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`). Default: `skip`. | When `skip`: warning logged, photo left as-is. When `moderate`: `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`. | Config value must be `skip` or `moderate`. | — | `nsfw.action.sensitive.no_album_fallback` | Owner directive, Q-045-03, Q-045-13 |
| FR-045-16 | ~~Removed — blocked photos are hard-deleted, so there are no blocked rows to hide. The Moderation page shows photos with `nsfw_status = review` (held for moderation) alongside photos with `is_validated = false` (upload trust level moderation).~~ | — | — | — | — | — |
| FR-045-17 | **`ApplyNsfwAlbumSensitivityJob`**: A queued job that applies the album NSFW marking for a photo with sensitive detections. Dispatched in two contexts: (1) **auto-approval path** — at callback time for `monitor`/`trust_but_verify`/`trusted` users when `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = mark_album`; (2) **admin approval path** — when an admin approves a moderated `check`-user photo that has `is_sensitive = true` detections and `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = mark_album`. The job iterates **all** of the photo's associated albums (`$photo->albums` via the `photo_album` pivot, Q-045-13 → A), and for each album checks `is_recursive_nsfw` (if any ancestor is already NSFW, skip) and sets `album.is_nsfw = true` if appropriate. If the photo has no albums (`$photo->albums->isEmpty()`), the `nsfw_sensitive_no_album_action` config applies (`skip` = log warning; `moderate` = set `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`). | Job dispatched → each associated album checked → marked if conditions met. | At least one album must exist; recursive NSFW check must pass. | No albums → `nsfw_sensitive_no_album_action` applies. | `nsfw.action.sensitive.album_marked` | Owner directive, Q-045-13 |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Driver | Measurement | Dependencies | Source |
|----|-------------|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| NFR-045-01 | NSFW scan must be fully asynchronous; upload latency must not increase. | UX parity with face detection. | Upload response time unchanged (<200ms delta). | Queue worker infrastructure. | Owner directive |
| NFR-045-02 | API key for NSFW service is stored in `.env` only (not in `configs` table), matching face detection pattern. | Security: prevent key exposure via admin settings UI. | Key not visible in `GET /Settings`. | `config/features.php` | Owner directive |
| NFR-045-03 | NSFW detection logging must not expose detection details to non-admin users. | Privacy / content sensitivity. | `nsfw_detections` table only accessible via admin endpoints. | — | Owner directive |
| NFR-045-04 | Feature requires both `ai_vision_enabled = 1` (global AI Vision toggle, shared with face detection) AND `ai_vision_nsfw_enabled = 1` (NSFW-specific toggle). Either being `0` prevents scans from being dispatched. Callback endpoint still accepts results regardless (the classifier may complete in-flight scans). Mirrors the `ai_vision_enabled` + `ai_vision_face_enabled` pattern. | Operator flexibility + consistency with face detection. | `ai_vision_enabled = 0` OR `ai_vision_nsfw_enabled = 0` → no NSFW scan dispatched even if `ai_vision_nsfw_enabled = true`. | — | Owner directive |
| NFR-045-05 | SE (Supporter Edition) gating: NSFW endpoints require basic SE license (not pro tier). Uses `support` middleware, not `support:pro` (Q-045-12). Routes are also gated by `feature:ai-vision` and `feature:v8` middleware, consistent with all other AI Vision endpoints. | SE feature + v8 feature flag. | Non-SE instances return 403; v8-disabled instances return 403. | SE licence check middleware (`support`), `feature:ai-vision`, `feature:v8`. | Owner directive, Q-045-12 |

## Branch & Scenario Matrix

| Scenario ID | Description / Expected outcome |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| S-045-01 | Photo uploaded by `check` user → NSFW scan dispatched, `nsfw_status = pending` |
| S-045-02 | Photo uploaded by `trusted` user + `nsfw_scan_trusted_users = true` → scan dispatched |
| S-045-03 | Photo uploaded by `trusted` user + `nsfw_scan_trusted_users = false` → scan NOT dispatched |
| S-045-04 | `check` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_check_block_action = block` → photo hard-deleted |
| S-045-05 | `check` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_check_block_action = moderate` → `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false` |
| S-045-06 | `check` user + `should_review = true` → `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false` |
| S-045-07 | `monitor` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_monitor_block_action = block` → photo hard-deleted |
| S-045-08 | `monitor` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_monitor_block_action = moderate` → `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false` |
| S-045-09 | `monitor` user + `should_review = true` → `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false` |
| S-045-10 | `trust_but_verify` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_trust_but_verify_block_action = moderate` → `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false` |
| S-045-10b | `trust_but_verify` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_trust_but_verify_block_action = block` → photo hard-deleted |
| S-045-11 | `trust_but_verify` user + `should_review = true` → no action (auto-approved) |
| S-045-12 | `trusted` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_trust_block_action = approve` → no action (auto-approved) |
| S-045-12b | `trusted` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_trust_block_action = moderate` → `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false` |
| S-045-12c | `trusted` user + `should_block = true` + `nsfw_trust_block_action = block` → photo hard-deleted |
| S-045-13 | `trusted` user + `should_review = true` → no action (auto-approved) |
| S-045-14 | `check` user + `is_sensitive = true` → `nsfw_status = review`; on admin approval with `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = mark_album`: set album `is_nsfw = true` (if not recursive NSFW) |
| S-045-15 | `monitor` user + `is_sensitive = true` + `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = mark_album` → set album `is_nsfw = true` immediately (if not recursive NSFW) |
| S-045-16 | `monitor` user + `is_sensitive = true` + `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = nothing` → no action |
| S-045-17 | `trust_but_verify` user + `is_sensitive = true` + `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = mark_album` → set album `is_nsfw = true` immediately (if not recursive NSFW) |
| S-045-18 | `trusted` user + `is_sensitive = true` + `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = mark_album` → set album `is_nsfw = true` immediately (if not recursive NSFW) |
| S-045-19 | Album already has ancestor with `is_nsfw = true` (recursive NSFW) + sensitive finding → album NOT re-marked |
| S-045-20 | NSFW service returns error → `nsfw_status = failed`, detections not logged |
| S-045-21 | Invalid API key on callback → 403 response |
| S-045-22 | `ai_vision_nsfw_enabled = false` → no scan dispatched on upload |
| S-045-23 | `ai_vision_enabled = false` (global AI Vision off) → no NSFW scan dispatched even if `ai_vision_nsfw_enabled = true` |
| S-045-24 | Bulk scan dispatched (default) → photos with `nsfw_status IS NULL` or `failed` queued |
| S-045-25 | Bulk scan dispatched with `force = true` → all photos including `completed` re-queued |
| S-045-26 | Photo has no album (unsorted) + sensitive action fires + `nsfw_sensitive_no_album_action = skip` → warning logged, no album change, no photo change |
| S-045-27 | Photo has no album (unsorted) + sensitive action fires + `nsfw_sensitive_no_album_action = moderate` → `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false` |
| S-045-28 | Preset is `default` → `preset` field omitted from request to classifier |
| S-045-29 | Preset is `strict` → `preset: "strict"` included in request |
| S-045-30 | Detection results logged: only `block_detected`, `review_detected`, `sensitive_detected` items are stored; `all_detected` is not persisted. A detection in multiple arrays gets one row with multiple booleans set |
| S-045-31 | Photo uploaded by `trust_but_verify` user → `is_validated = true`, NSFW scan dispatched |
| ~~S-045-32~~ | ~~Removed — no blocked rows to hide (block = hard-delete).~~ |
| ~~S-045-33~~ | ~~Removed — no blocked toggle needed.~~ |
| S-045-34 | Admin approves photo with sensitive detections + `nsfw_sensitive_album_action = mark_album` + album not recursive NSFW → album marked NSFW |
| S-045-35 | Admin approves photo with sensitive detections + album already recursive NSFW → album NOT re-marked |
| S-045-36 | Admin fetches NSFW config → proxy returns upstream JSON with `config` and `presets` sections |
| S-045-37 | Admin fetches NSFW config but service URL not configured → 503 with config error |
| S-045-38 | Admin fetches NSFW config but service unreachable → 503 with connectivity error |
| S-045-39 | `monitor` user + `nsfw_monitor_hide_on_scan = true` → photo `is_validated = false` at dispatch; clean callback (no block/review) → `is_validated = true` restored (unconditional for non-`check`) |
| S-045-40 | `trust_but_verify` user + `nsfw_trust_but_verify_hide_on_scan = true` → photo `is_validated = false` at dispatch; clean callback → `is_validated = true` restored |
| S-045-41 | `trusted` user + `nsfw_trust_hide_on_scan = true` → photo `is_validated = false` at dispatch; clean callback → `is_validated = true` restored |
| S-045-42 | `monitor` user + `nsfw_monitor_hide_on_scan = true` + callback with block/review findings → photo stays `is_validated = false` (normal matrix applies) |
| S-045-43 | `monitor` user + `nsfw_monitor_hide_on_scan = false` → photo `is_validated` unchanged at dispatch (remains `true`); clean callback still sets `is_validated = true` (no-op) |

## Test Strategy

- **Core:** Unit tests for `NsfwPreset` enum, `NsfwStatus` enum, `NsfwDetectionLabel` enum, `NsfwBlockFindingAction`/`NsfwSensitiveAlbumAction` enums, detection tier deduplication logic.
- **Application:** Unit tests for `NsfwDetectionService` (request building, preset omission), `NsfwActionService` (action application per trust-tier × finding-tier matrix), `AutoScanNsfwOnUpload` pipe (trust level gating including `trust_but_verify`).
- **REST:** Feature tests for `POST /NsfwDetection/results` (valid payload, invalid key, error status, each trust-tier × finding combination), `POST /NsfwDetection/bulk-scan` (admin gate).
- **Integration:** Tests for approval-time album marking (recursive NSFW check, no-album fallback).
- **CLI:** None (no CLI commands in v1).
- **UI:** Manual verification of settings toggles, Maintenance bulk scan card, and Moderation page filtering.

## Interface & Contract Catalogue

### Domain Objects

| ID | Description | Modules |
|----|-------------|---------|
| DO-045-01 | `NsfwDetection` model — stores per-detection label, confidence, bbox, area, tier for a photo | application, REST |
| DO-045-02 | `NsfwPreset` enum — `DEFAULT`, `STRICT`, `MODERATION`, `NUDE_FEMALE`, `PERMISSIVE`, `SOCIAL_MEDIA` | core, application |
| DO-045-03 | `NsfwBlockFindingAction` enum — `BLOCK`, `MODERATE`, `APPROVE`. `APPROVE` is only valid for `nsfw_trust_block_action` (trusted tier). | core, application |
| DO-045-04 | `NsfwSensitiveAlbumAction` enum — `MARK_ALBUM`, `NOTHING` | core, application |
| DO-045-05 | ~~`NsfwModerationAction` enum~~ — removed. Review findings are no longer configurable; the matrix determines action by trust tier. | — |
| DO-045-06 | `NsfwStatus` enum — `PENDING`, `FAILED`, `REVIEW`, `VISIBLE`. Replaces both the previous `NsfwScanStatus` and `NsfwVisibility` enums. Single column `nsfw_status` on `photos` tracks scan progress and moderation state. No `BLOCKED` value — block actions hard-delete the photo. | core, application |
| ~~DO-045-07~~ | ~~`NsfwDetectionTier` enum~~ — removed. Replaced by three boolean columns (`is_block`, `is_review`, `is_sensitive`) on `nsfw_detections` since a detection can belong to multiple tiers simultaneously. | — |
| ~~DO-045-08~~ | ~~`NsfwVisibility` enum~~ — removed. Merged into `NsfwStatus` (DO-045-06). | — |
| DO-045-11 | `NsfwDetectionLabel` enum — `FEMALE_GENITALIA_COVERED`, `FACE_FEMALE`, `BUTTOCKS_EXPOSED`, `FEMALE_BREAST_EXPOSED`, `FEMALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED`, `MALE_BREAST_EXPOSED`, `ANUS_EXPOSED`, `FEET_EXPOSED`, `BELLY_COVERED`, `FEET_COVERED`, `ARMPITS_COVERED`, `ARMPITS_EXPOSED`, `FACE_MALE`, `BELLY_EXPOSED`, `MALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED`, `ANUS_COVERED`, `FEMALE_BREAST_COVERED`, `BUTTOCKS_COVERED`. Used as the `label` column type on `nsfw_detections`. | core, application |
| DO-045-09 | `UserUploadTrustLevel` enum — updated with new `TRUST_BUT_VERIFY` case | core, application |
| DO-045-10 | `NsfwSensitiveNoAlbumAction` enum — `SKIP`, `MODERATE` | core, application |

### API Routes / Services

| ID | Transport | Description | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------------|-------|
| API-045-01 | REST POST /api/v2/NsfwDetection/results | Callback from NSFW classifier service | Auth: X-API-Key header. No user session. |
| API-045-02 | REST POST /api/v2/NsfwDetection/bulk-scan | Admin: enqueue all unscanned photos for NSFW scan | Auth: admin middleware |
| API-045-03 | HTTP POST /api/nsfw/detect (outbound) | Request sent to NSFW classifier service | Sent by `DispatchNsfwScanJob` |
| API-045-04 | REST GET /api/v2/NsfwDetection/config | Admin: proxy to NSFW classifier `GET /api/nsfw/config` — returns runtime config and available presets | Auth: admin session. Proxies upstream response as-is. |
| API-045-05 | HTTP GET /api/nsfw/config (outbound) | Config/presets request sent to NSFW classifier service | Proxied by `NsfwConfigController::show()` |

### Telemetry Events

| ID | Event name | Fields / Redaction rules |
|----|-----------|---------------------------|
| TE-045-01 | nsfw.scan.dispatched | `photo_id`, `preset` |
| TE-045-02 | nsfw.results.received | `photo_id`, `should_block`, `should_review`, `is_sensitive`, `detection_count` |
| TE-045-03 | nsfw.action.block | `photo_id`, `action` (deleted/moderated/approved), `upload_trust_level` |
| TE-045-04 | nsfw.action.moderate | `photo_id`, `action` (moderated/approved), `upload_trust_level` |
| TE-045-05 | nsfw.action.sensitive | `photo_id`, `album_id`, `action` (mark_album/nothing/moderate), `upload_trust_level` |
| TE-045-06 | nsfw.bulk_scan.dispatched | `photo_count` |
| TE-045-07 | nsfw.action.sensitive.album_marked | `photo_id`, `album_id` — emitted when album is marked NSFW at approval time |

### UI States

| ID | State | Trigger / Expected outcome |
|----|-------|---------------------------|
| UI-045-01 | NSFW settings section in admin Settings page | Admin navigates to Settings → NSFW Detection section visible with trust-tier matrix summary |
| UI-045-02 | Bulk NSFW Scan card in Maintenance page | Admin navigates to Maintenance → card visible when `ai_vision_nsfw_enabled = true` |
| UI-045-03 | Moderation page with NSFW status column | Photos with `nsfw_status = review` shown with NSFW badge; no blocked filter needed |
| UI-045-04 | NSFW Presets overview admin page | Admin navigates to `/admin/nsfw-config` → page fetches upstream config, displays service runtime settings and all available presets with their block/review/sensitive label-set details. Accessible from admin dashboard tile (visible when AI Vision enabled). Shows loading spinner while fetching; error panel when service unreachable. |

## Telemetry & Observability

All NSFW events are logged via Laravel's `Log` facade at `info` level. Detection details (labels, confidence scores) are logged but not included in user-facing responses. The `nsfw_detections` table provides a persistent audit trail accessible only by admin.

## Documentation Deliverables

- Update `docs/specs/4-architecture/knowledge-map.md` with NSFW detection modules.
- Update `docs/specs/4-architecture/roadmap.md` with Feature 045 entry.
- Create `docs/specs/2-how-to/configure-nsfw-detection.md` (deferred to follow-up).

## Appendix

### Trust-Tier × Finding-Tier Action Matrix (detailed)

This matrix is the core decision engine for the NSFW action system. It replaces the previous per-finding-tier config approach with a unified trust-aware model.

#### Block Findings (`should_block = true`)

| Trust Level | Action | Configurable? |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| Check | Block (delete) or Moderate | Yes — `nsfw_check_block_action` (default: `block`) |
| Monitor | Block (delete) or Moderate | Yes — `nsfw_monitor_block_action` (default: `moderate`) |
| Trust but verify | Block (delete) or Moderate | Yes — `nsfw_trust_but_verify_block_action` (default: `moderate`) |
| Trusted | Block (delete), Moderate, or Approve | Yes — `nsfw_trust_block_action` (default: `approve`) |

**Block = hard-delete the photo** via a dedicated force-delete method on `Actions\Photo\Delete` that reuses existing pivot cleanup, purchasable cleanup, `PhotoWillBeDeleted`/`PhotoDeleted` event dispatch, and size variant file deletion (Q-045-14 → A). The photo is removed from **all** associated albums unconditionally — no surviving row, no `blocked` status. The `nsfw_detections` rows are cleaned up both by the force-delete method (`PhotosToBeDeletedDTO`) and by FK cascade (Q-045-19). Each trust tier has its own config with progressively relaxed defaults: `check` → `block` (strictest), `monitor` → `moderate`, `trust_but_verify` → `moderate`, `trusted` → `approve` (most permissive). The `trusted` tier additionally supports `approve` to completely skip action on block findings.

#### Review Findings (`should_review = true`)

| Trust Level | Action | Configurable? |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| Check | Moderate | No — always moderate |
| Monitor | Moderate | No — always moderate |
| Trust but verify | Approve (no action) | No — always approve |
| Trusted | Approve (no action) | No — always approve |

#### Sensitive Findings (`is_sensitive = true`)

| Trust Level | Action on photo | Action on album | Configurable? |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Check | Moderate | Mark album NSFW at approval time | Album action: `nsfw_sensitive_album_action` |
| Monitor | No action | Mark album NSFW immediately (or nothing) | Album action: `nsfw_sensitive_album_action` |
| Trust but verify | No action | Mark album NSFW immediately (or nothing) | Album action: `nsfw_sensitive_album_action` |
| Trusted | No action | Mark album NSFW immediately (or nothing) | Album action: `nsfw_sensitive_album_action` |

**Album marking rules (Q-045-13 → A):**
1. **All** of the photo's associated albums are checked (`$photo->albums` via `photo_album` many-to-many pivot — photos no longer have a direct `album_id` FK).
2. For each album, check `is_recursive_nsfw`. If any ancestor is already NSFW, skip marking that album (it is already effectively NSFW).
3. If the photo has no albums (unsorted, i.e. `$photo->albums->isEmpty()`), the `nsfw_sensitive_no_album_action` config controls fallback: `skip` (log and do nothing) or `moderate` (set `nsfw_status = review`, `is_validated = false`).
4. Album marking is always executed via `ApplyNsfwAlbumSensitivityJob` (queued job), not inline in the controller or callback handler.
5. For `check` users, the job is dispatched at **admin approval time** — the photo is moderated first, and only when the admin approves does the job run. This prevents a false positive from flipping an album to NSFW without human review.
6. For `monitor`/`trust_but_verify`/`trusted` users, the job is dispatched **immediately** at callback time (auto-approval path — the photo is not held for moderation on sensitive findings alone).

### `trust_but_verify` Trust Level

This new tier fills the gap between `monitor` and `trusted`:

| Property | Check | Monitor | Trust but verify | Trusted |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| `is_validated` on upload | `false` | `true` (or `false` if `nsfw_monitor_hide_on_scan`) | `true` (or `false` if `nsfw_trust_but_verify_hide_on_scan`) | `true` (or `false` if `nsfw_trust_hide_on_scan`) |
| NSFW scan dispatched | Always | Always | Always | Configurable |
| Block finding | Block/Moderate | Block/Moderate | Block/Moderate | Block/Moderate/Approve |
| Review finding | Moderate | Moderate | Approve | Approve |
| Sensitive finding | Moderate + deferred album | Album action | Album action | Album action |

Use case: users who are generally trusted but whose uploads should still be screened for the most severe (block-tier) content. Review-tier findings are considered acceptable for these users, but block-tier content is configurable (default: moderated for admin review).

### Config Keys Summary

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `ai_vision_nsfw_enabled` | bool | `0` | Enable/disable NSFW scanning |
| `nsfw_preset` | string | `default` | Detection preset sent to classifier |
| `nsfw_check_block_action` | string | `block` | Action for block findings on `check` users: `block` or `moderate` |
| `nsfw_monitor_block_action` | string | `moderate` | Action for block findings on `monitor` users: `block` or `moderate` |
| `nsfw_trust_but_verify_block_action` | string | `moderate` | Action for block findings on `trust_but_verify` users: `block` or `moderate` |
| `nsfw_trust_block_action` | string | `approve` | Action for block findings on `trusted` users: `block`, `moderate`, or `approve` |
| `nsfw_sensitive_album_action` | string | `mark_album` | Action for sensitive findings: `mark_album` or `nothing` |
| `nsfw_sensitive_no_album_action` | string | `skip` | Fallback when sensitive fires on unsorted photo: `skip` or `moderate` |
| `nsfw_scan_trusted_users` | bool | `0` | Whether to scan trusted users' uploads |
| `nsfw_monitor_hide_on_scan` | bool | `0` | Hide `monitor` user photos (`is_validated = false`) while NSFW scan is in progress. Restored on clean result; stays hidden if classifier crashes. |
| `nsfw_trust_but_verify_hide_on_scan` | bool | `0` | Hide `trust_but_verify` user photos while NSFW scan is in progress. Same behaviour as above. |
| `nsfw_trust_hide_on_scan` | bool | `0` | Hide `trusted` user photos while NSFW scan is in progress. Same behaviour as above. |

### Example Outbound Request (Lychee → NSFW classifier)

```json
{
  "photo_id": "42",
  "photo_path": "2024/01/photo.jpg",
  "preset": "strict"
}
```

When preset is `default`, the request body is:

```json
{
  "photo_id": "42",
  "photo_path": "2024/01/photo.jpg"
}
```

### Example Upstream Config Response (NSFW classifier → Lychee via proxy)

`GET /api/nsfw/config` — proxied through `GET /api/v2/NsfwDetection/config`:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "confidence_threshold": "0.1",
    "area_ratio_threshold": "0.0",
    "block": "{\"labels\": [\"FEMALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED\", ...], \"confidence\": null, ...}",
    "review": "...",
    "sensitive": "...",
    "queue_backend": "database",
    "queue_max_size": "0",
    "thread_pool_size": "1",
    "verify_ssl": "true",
    "workers": "1"
  },
  "presets": {
    "default": {
      "name": "default",
      "description": "Built-in default configuration used when no preset is selected.",
      "block": {
        "labels": ["FEMALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED", "MALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED", "ANUS_EXPOSED"],
        "confidence": null,
        "area_ratio": null,
        "label_thresholds": {}
      },
      "review": {
        "labels": ["BUTTOCKS_EXPOSED", "FEMALE_BREAST_EXPOSED"],
        "confidence": null,
        "area_ratio": null,
        "label_thresholds": {}
      },
      "sensitive": {
        "labels": ["FEMALE_BREAST_COVERED", "FEMALE_GENITALIA_COVERED", "ANUS_COVERED", "BUTTOCKS_COVERED", "BELLY_EXPOSED"],
        "confidence": null,
        "area_ratio": null,
        "label_thresholds": {}
      }
    },
    "strict": { "name": "strict", "description": "Block all exposed nudity. ...", "block": {"...": "..."}, "review": {"...": "..."}, "sensitive": {"...": "..."} },
    "moderation": { "...": "..." },
    "nude_female": { "...": "..." },
    "permissive": { "...": "..." },
    "social_media": { "...": "..." }
  }
}
```

Each preset's `block`, `review`, and `sensitive` objects share the same label-set shape:
- `labels` — `string[]` — detection labels assigned to this tier
- `confidence` — `float|null` — global confidence threshold override (null = use service default)
- `area_ratio` — `float|null` — global area ratio threshold override (null = use service default)
- `label_thresholds` — `Record<string, float>` — per-label confidence overrides

### Detection Storage

Only detections from `block_detected`, `review_detected`, and `sensitive_detected` are persisted. Items in `all_detected` that do not appear in any of the three action arrays are not stored (Q-045-06).

A single detection can appear in multiple arrays simultaneously (e.g., in both `block_detected` and `sensitive_detected`). Instead of picking the highest tier, all three memberships are stored as boolean columns on a single row:
- `is_block` — detection appears in `block_detected`
- `is_review` — detection appears in `review_detected`
- `is_sensitive` — detection appears in `sensitive_detected`

Detections are deduplicated by photo_id + label + bbox coordinates: if the same photo_id+label+bbox appears in two arrays, one row is created with both booleans set to `true`.
