# Decisions

We track significant choices as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Each ADR is immutable; superseded entries should point at their replacements.

Numbering convention: `ADR-XXXX` where `XXXX` is zero-padded and increments sequentially.

| ADR | Status   | Summary                            |
|-----|----------|------------------------------------|
| [ADR-0001](ADR-XXX-adr-feature-decision.md) | Accepted | Summary of adr feature decision |

## Templates

- Use [docs/specs/templates/adr-template.md](docs/specs/templates/adr-template.md) when creating new ADRs.
- Each ADR documents context, decision, consequences, alternatives, security/privacy, operational impact, and reference links, plus pointers to the affected specs/open-questions.
