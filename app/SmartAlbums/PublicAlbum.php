/**
 * Smart built-in album "Public".
 *
 * The Public album lists all photos which are explicitly made public.
 * The album des not include photos which are public due to being part of
 * a public album.
 * This behaviour is intended due to the following reasons:
 *
 *  1. If all photos (including those of public albums) were included, the
 *     album would become huge and unusable.
 *     Especially, the load time would be HUGE even for mid-size
 *     installations.
 *  2. The whole purpose of the smart album is to easily spot public photos
 *     which are accidentally public, but are not meant to be public.
 *     While public albums can be easily found, this is not true for photos
 *     which are made public individually.
