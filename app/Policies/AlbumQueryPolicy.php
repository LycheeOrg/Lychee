	 * Restricts an album query to _browsable_ albums.

	 * An album is called _browsable_, if
	 *
	 *   1. there is a path from the origin to the album, and

	 * are a _local_ properties, _browsability_ is a _global_ property.
	 *
	 * **Attention**:
	 * For efficiency reasons this method does not check if `$origin` itself
	 * is reachable.
	 * The method simply assumes that the user has already legitimately
	 * accessed the origin album, if the caller provides an album model.

	 *
	 *   1. there is a path from the origin to the album, and
	 *   2. no album on that path is unreachable
	 *
	 * Note that the worst case efficiency of this query is O(n²), if n is
	 * the number of query results.
	 * The query does not "know" that albums are organized in a tree structure
	 * and thus re-examines the entire path for each album in the result and
	 * does not take a short-cut for sub-paths which have already been examined
	 * previously.
	 * In other words for a flat tree (all result nodes are direct children
	 * of the origin), the runtime is O(n), but for a high tree (the nodes are
	 * basically a sequence), the runtime is O(n²).
