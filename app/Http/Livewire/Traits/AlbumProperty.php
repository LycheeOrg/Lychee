 * This trait is use to take care and simulate an AbstractAlbum attribute.
 * AbstractAlbum cannot be a Livewire component attribute because it is an interface.
 * For this reason, we take advantage of the fact that an abstract album is either a baseAlbum or a smartAlbum.
 * Both of the later are wireable.
 * As a consequence, OBJECT->album is effectively being a FACADE for the property.
