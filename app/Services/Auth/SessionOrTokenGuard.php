/**
 * A custom Guard which combines the default Laravel Session Guard with
 * a token Guard in an OR-like fashion.
 *
 * In Laravel terms a Guard is a service class which defines _how_ the user
 * of a request is determined
 * (see https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authentication#introduction).
 * This guard behaves as follows:
 *
 *  _ If a request has neither a session nor sends an API token, the request
 *    counts as unauthenticated.
 *    In other words, the returned user equals `null`.
 *  - If a request has no session, but the request sends an API token, the
 *    API token is used for user authentication.
 *  - If a request has a session and sends no API token, the previously
 *    stored user is loaded from the session.
 *    If such a user does not exist, the request is unauthenticated.
 *  - If a request has both a session _and_ sends an API token, this guard
 *    ensures consistency between the both; i.e. the user stored inside the
 *    session and indicated by the token must be the same.
 *    Normally, a client is expected to either use session-based login or
 *    use token authentication, not both simultaneously.
 *    If a client is crazy enough to use both but fails to keep it consistent,
 *    this counts as a client-side error.
 *    Lychee also uses a session for other things like storing the list of
 *    unlocked albums and a "jumping" user might lead to leaking undesired
 *    information.
 *
 * Laravel ships with three guards out-of-the-box:
 *
 *  - {@link \Illuminate\Auth\SessionGuard}
 *  - {@link \Illuminate\Auth\TokenGuard}
 *  - {@link \Illuminate\Auth\RequestGuard}
 *
 * which behave in the obvious way:
 *
 *  - {@link \Illuminate\Auth\SessionGuard} is an stateful guard and works
 *    together with {@link \Illuminate\Contracts\Session\Session}.
 *    This guard expects that the user is once explicitly set via `loginAs`
 *    (or similar methods). Then the guard stores the user inside the session
 *    and fetches the previously stored user from the session during
 *    subsequent request.
 *  - {@link \Illuminate\Auth\TokenGuard} is a stateless guard and uses a
 *    proprietary HTTP header to transmit an "API token".
 *    The token must be sent by the client for each request.
 *  - {@link \Illuminate\Auth\RequestGuard} is a stateless guard and uses a
 *    standard HTTP authentication techniques (such as HTTP digest) via the
 *    HTTP authentication header.
 *
 * The available guards are configured in `config/auth.php`.
 * Note that the configuration file uses the term "guard" in a different way
 * than above (Laravel I love you soooo much).
 * In `config/auth.php` several "presets" can be configured below the array
 * key `'guards'`, the actual guard to be used (as listed above) is configured
 * via `'driver'`.
 * The default preset to be used for all request unless stated otherwise on a
 * route, is set in `default`.
 * Laravel is built around the idea that a particular route uses either one
 * of the guards above, i.e. _either_ uses `SessionGuard`, `TokenGuard` or
 * `RequestGuard`.
 *
 * Lychee is special in this case.
 * Lychee allows to use a session-based login _or_ a token authentication
 * for the same route.
 * Hence, we use a special guard.
 *
 * Laravel uses {@link \Illuminate\Auth\AuthManager::resolve()} to resolve
 * the guard at runtime.
 * The built-in guards {@link \Illuminate\Auth\SessionGuard} and
 * {@link \Illuminate\Auth\TokenGuard} are created via
 * the magic line
 * `$driverMethod = 'create'.ucfirst($config['driver']).'Driver';`
 * which is why the "special" identifiers `"session"` and `"token"` work
 * inside the file `config/auth.php`.
 * Custom identifiers can be registered `Auth::extend` and become a
 * "custom creator" inside {@link \Illuminate\Auth\AuthManager::resolve()}.
