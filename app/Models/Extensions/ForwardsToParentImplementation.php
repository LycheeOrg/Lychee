/**
 * Trait ForwardsToParentImplementation.
 *
 * This trait is supposed to be used by "child" classes of a parent-child
 * relation that follows the design pattern as described in
 * {@link \App\Models\BaseAlbumImpl}.
 * This trait assumes that the using "child" classes provides a relation
 * called `base_class` which returns an instance of
 * {@link BelongsTo} and refers
 * to the implementation of the "parent" class.
 * This trait forwards calls to properties and relations which are not
 * defined by the "child" class to the "parent" class and therewith
 * mimics a behaviour as if the properties and relations of the parent
 * class were actually inherited by the "child" class.
 * Moreover, this trait ensures that the parent class is saved/created before
 * the child class is saved/created and that the (inherited) timestamp of
 * the parent class is touched when the child class is modified.

	 *     {@link \Illuminate\Database\Concerns\HasAttributes::getAttribute()}
	 *     would have fallen through.
	 *  3. While the middle part is basically a copy of the original code,
	 *     we had to tweak it slightly.
	 *     The original code calls `getRelationValue`, if the `$key` is not
	 *     an attribute, but we had to inline the code of `getRelationValue`
	 *     here due to two reasons:
	 *
	 *      1. This trait also overwrites `getRelationValue` such that
	 *         `getRelationValue` checks for a relation on both the child
	 *         and the parent model.
	 *         But here, we only must check on the child model, so we must
	 *         not call `getRelationValue`.
	 *      2. If `getRelationValue` returns `null` it is impossible to
	 *         distinguish, if `null` has been returned because the relation
	 *         exists and equals null or if no relation of that name exists
	 *         at all.
	 *         However, only in the latter case we want to forward the call to
	 *         the parent.
	 *         In the former case, we must return null directly.
