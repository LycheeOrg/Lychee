/**
 * Deletes the albums with the designated IDs **efficiently**.
 *
 * This class deliberately violates the principle of separations of concerns.
 * In an ideal world, the method would simply call `->delete()` on every
 * `Album` model, the `Album` model would take care of deleting its
 * sub-albums and every album in turn would take care of deleting its photos.
 * But this is extremely inefficient due to Laravel's architecture:
 *
 *  - Models are heavyweight god classes such that every instance also carries
 *    the whole code for serialization/deserialization
 *  - Models are active records (and don't use the unit-of-work pattern), i.e.
 *    every deletion of a model directly triggers a DB operation; they are
 *    not deferred into a batch operation
 *
 * Moreover, while removing the records for albums and photos from the
 * DB can be implemented rather efficiently, the actual file operations may
 * take some time.
 * Especially, if the files are not stored locally but on a remote file system.
 * Hence, this method collects all files which need to be removed.
 * The caller can then decide to delete them asynchronously.

	/**
	 * Deletes the given set of regular albums incl. their descendants from DB.
	 *
	 * This is ugly as hell and is mostly copy & pasted from
	 * {@link \Kalnoy\Nestedset\NodeTrait} with adoptions.
	 * I really liked the code of master@0199212 ways better, but it was
	 * simply too inefficient
	 *
	 * This code also fixes a bug when more than one album with
	 * sub-albums is deleted, i.e. if we delete a "sub-forest".
	 * The original code (of the nested set model) updates the
	 * (lft,rgt)-indices on the DB level for every single deletion.
	 * However, this way deletion of the second albums fails, if the
	 * second album has already been hydrated earlier, because the
	 * indices of the already hydrated models and the indices in the
	 * DB are out-of-sync.
	 * Either all remaining models needs to be re-hydrated aka
	 * "refreshed" from the (already updated) DB after every single
	 * deletion or the update of the DB needs to be postponed until
	 * all models have been deleted.
	 * The latter is more efficient, because we do not reload models
	 * from the DB.
