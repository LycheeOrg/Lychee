/**
 * Deletes the albums with the designated IDs **efficiently**.
 *
 * This class deliberately violates the principle of separations of concerns.
 * In an ideal world, the method would simply call `->delete()` on every
 * `Album` model, the `Album` model would take care of deleting its
 * sub-albums and every album in turn would take care of deleting its photos.
 * But this is extremely inefficient due to Laravel's architecture:
 *
 *  - Models are heavyweight god classes such that every instance also carries
 *    the whole code for serialization/deserialization
 *  - Models are active records (and don't use the unit-of-work pattern), i.e.
 *    every deletion of a model directly triggers a DB operation; they are
 *    not deferred into a batch operation
 *
 * Moreover, while removing the records for albums and photos from the
 * DB can be implemented rather efficiently, the actual file operations may
 * take some time.
 * Especially, if the files are not stored locally but on a remote file system.
 * Hence, this method collects all files which need to be removed.
 * The caller can then decide to delete them asynchronously.

	 * been collected.
	 * This object can (and must) be used to eventually delete the files,
