	 * might change.
	 *
	 * There are 5 possibilities for the source file:
	 *
	 *  1. the source file has been uploaded by a client
	 *  2. the source file has been downloaded from a remote server
	 *  3. the source file is a local file on the server and
	 *      a) shall be deleted
	 *      b) shall be copied
	 *      c) shall be symlinked
	 *
	 * Cases 1 trough 3a can be treated identically:
	 * In all three cases we have a local (possibly temporary) file which
	 * will be removed anyway and thus can be modified in place.
	 *
	 * In case 3b, we make a local, temporary copy first and then proceed as
	 * in the first 3 cases.
	 * This is also the case which changes the {@link MediaFile}-instance.
	 *
	 * In case 3c, the method does not actually modify the file.
	 *
	 * This method also updates the attributes {@link Photo::$filesize}
	 * and {@link Photo::$checksum} to the new values after rotation.
