		// we delete the "imported" file and do not want to import via symlink.
		// We do not want to skip duplicates (in case the photo is already a
		// duplicate, we still want to rotate it) and we want to re-sync
		// metadata (after rotation width, height and filesize may have changed).
		//
		// In case the photo has originally been imported as a symbolic link,
		// the photo won't be a symbolic link after rotation, but become an
		// independent file which is detached from the original target of the
		// symbolic link.
		// This is by design.

		//  1. Rotate the original photo which the symlink points to.
		//  2. Bail out with an error message, if the user attempts to rotate
		//     a photo that was imported via a symlink
		// After discussion among the developers, option 1 was considered a
		// no-go and 2 was considered to be too restrictive.
