# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Lychee uses a rolling release system, **we do not backport fixes to previously released versions**.
Those are the versions where we accept vulnerability reports.

| Version          | Supported          |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| master           | :heavy_check_mark: |
| latest release   | :white_check_mark: |
| < latest release | :x:                |
| < 6.0            | :x:                |
