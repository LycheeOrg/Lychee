# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Lychee uses a rolling release system, **we do not backport fixes to previously released versions**.
Those are the versions where we accept vulnerability reports.

| Version | Supported          |

| master  | :heavy_check_mark: |
| latest release  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |
