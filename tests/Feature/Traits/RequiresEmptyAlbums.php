 * It ensures that the respective DB tables are empty.

 * This trait does not take care of photos which might happen to be
 * in the albums.
 * Hence, this trait will raise exceptions if it tries to delete an album
 * which still contains photos due to violated foreign key constraints.
 * Hence, this trait should be used in combination with
 * {@link RequiresEmptyPhotos} and `RequiresEmptyPhotos` must run before
