CVE-2026-25793
# This CVE is stupid and disputed.
# The "vulnerability" is that php-jwt accepts short HMAC keys without validation.
# This is not a library bug — key management is the caller's responsibility.
# PHP's own hash_hmac() and openssl_sign() behave identically and have no CVEs for this.
# NVD agrees — hence the Disputed tag and no score from NIST.
